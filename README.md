Team Rage for Software Engineering Projects
===========================================

To install:

* Make sure you have MySQL and PHP 5 installed on a server
* Copy the team_rage directory to a web accessible location
* Create an empty database in mysql (preferably named team_rage)
* Execute the setup.sql script on your MySQL server
* Add members to the team using your database editing tool of choice (follow the "derp" user creation in setup.sql) using your SQL tool of choice - no admin interface yet, sorry </3>
* Edit config.php to mirror your MySQL database settings
* Enjoy!
